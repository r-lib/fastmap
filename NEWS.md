fastmap 1.1.1.9000
=============

* Changed `fastmap`'s `$has()` method to use C++ `contains()` method (which is new in hopscotch-map 2.3.0). (#30)

* Previously calling `$mset()` with empty input would result in an error; now it is a no-op. (#38)

fastmap 1.1.1
=============

* Updated hopscotch-map library to 2.3.0.

* Closed #24: Added a `$clone()` method to `fastmap`. (#26)

* Fixed #27: If a `fastmap` object has no holes in the lists storing keys and values, and then it is serialized and then unserialized, the new `fastmap` would contain zero items. (#28)

* Faster implementations of `fastmap` `$keys()` and `$as_list()` methods.


fastmap 1.1.0
=============

* Added `faststack()` and `fastqueue()`. (#15)


fastmap 1.0.1
=============

* Fixed #13: fastmap.cpp now explicitly includes the algorithm header, which is needed on some platforms to successfully compile.
